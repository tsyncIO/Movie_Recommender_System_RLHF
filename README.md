# **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) for Movie Recommendations**

This project demonstrates how to apply **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** combined with **Human Feedback** (RLHF) to optimize a movie recommender system. By using human feedback, the system continuously learns from users' interactions and improves its recommendations over time.

## **Introduction**

In this project, we build a recommender system based on the **MovieLens dataset**. We implement **Reinforcement Learning** techniques, such as **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, to optimize the movie recommendation process. The recommender system integrates **Human Feedback** to improve over time based on users' ratings and choices.

This system is an example of applying RL and RLHF in a production-grade environment, allowing for dynamic recommendations and personalized user experiences.
